### Gurman
-What went right? Was able to connect to the database and implement a few basic menus, a service, and a model.

### Joshua
-All the requirements for the MVP were there. 
-Nothing too harsh occurred with connecting or using the database.

-The UI is also kind of bad and inconsistent between the student and faculty
### Mike 
-I think my demo went smoothly, even though I did have two exceptions handled poorly.
